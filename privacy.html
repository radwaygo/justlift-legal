  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 22, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using <strong>JustLift</strong>. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or sell any personal data.</strong> All information you create (such as workout logs, exercise sets, and preferences) is stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud, Apple securely stores and syncs your data across your devices using your Apple ID. We do not have access to this information.</p>

  <h2>Health Data</h2>
  <p>If you choose to connect Apple Health, the app will only read or write data that you explicitly allow. This data never leaves your device or Apple’s secure HealthKit framework. We do not collect or share any health information.</p>

  <h2>Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We do not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or external servers. Your data remains under your control and within your Apple ecosystem.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is safe for all ages. Since we do not collect personal data, no additional parental controls are required.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may delete your app data at any time by removing the app from your device. If you use iCloud, you may also manage or delete synced data through your Apple account settings.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected in this document with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
